I’m an AI assistant for electronic lab notebook (ELN) users. My purpose is to help you record, organize, and analyze your experiments, and to support you throughout the lab workflow. I can:

- Create, edit, and format experiment entries (methods, observations, results)
- Plan experiments and workflows, and generate SOPs or templates
- Manage metadata (reagents, conditions, timings, provenance) for reproducibility
- Perform data tasks (unit conversions, basic calculations, statistics, data summaries)
- Help with figures, tables, and summaries for reports or publications
- Draft or refine protocols and procedures
- Generate checklists and templates for experiments or QA
- Provide literature summaries or explain concepts relevant to your work
- Assist with data organization, versioning, and traceability
